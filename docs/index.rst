SpinSim Python Package
==========================================
SpinSim is a package created to make the process of construct the matrix representation
of a hamiltonian more easily. Also, a lot of functions and workflow are implementated to 
compute different quantities (magnetothermal, entropy, entanglement and others).

In the different sections you can find some examples and explanations of how to use the code.
